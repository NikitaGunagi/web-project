        <h1>THE INDIAN NAVY</h1>
        <p>As compared to other <br>professions in the civilian world,<br> the Indian Navy has a great deal<br> to offer to young men and <br>women.</p>
    
</div>
<div id="abtpara">
<p>The Indian Navy is a well-balanced and cohesive three-dimensional force, capable of operating above, on and under the surface of the oceans, efficiently <br>
    safeguarding our national interests.<br><br>
   The Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) exercises operational and administrative control of the Indian Navy from the Integrated Headquarters of Ministry of Defence (Navy).<br>
    He is assisted by the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff (VCNS) and three other Principal Staff Officers, namely the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (DCNS), the Chief of<br>
     Personnel (COP) and the Chief of Material (COM).</p>

<p>The Western and the Eastern Naval Commands are ‘Operational Commands’, and exercise control over operations in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal <br>
    respectively. The Southern Command is the Training Command.</p>
    <p>The cutting edge of the Indian Navy are its two Fleets, namely the Western Fleet, based at Mumbai and the Eastern Fleet, based at Visakhapatnam. Besides the Fleets, <br>
        there is a Flotilla each, based at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam and Port Blair (A & N Islands), that provide Local Naval Defence in their respective regions. Naval ships are<br>
         also based at other ports along the East and the West coasts of India and the island territories, thus ensuring continued naval presence in the areas of national<br>
          interest. Further, there are various Naval Officer-in-Charges (NOICs), under each Command, responsible for the Local Naval Defence of ports under their respective <br>
          jurisdictions.</p>

    <p>
        India has a rich maritime heritage and the earliest reference to maritime activities is contained in the Rig Veda. </p>
        <p>Indian mythology has numerous episodes pertaining to the ocean, the sea and the rivers, with belief that mankind has benefitted </p>
        <p>from the wealth of seas and ocean. There is plenty of evidence derived from Indian literature, art, sculptures, painting and archeology</p>
        <p> to establish existence of Indian maritime traditions.</p>

        <p>A study of the country's maritime history reveals that the Indian sub-continent exercised supremacy over the Indian Ocean from very early </p>
        <p>times up to the 13th century. Indians took to the sea for trade and commerce rather than for political ends. Thus, the period up to about 16th </p>
        <p>century witnessed peaceful sea-borne commerce, cultural and traditional exchange between countries. The Indian Ocean has always been regarded as an </p>
        <p>area of great significance and India is central to this Ocean.
